# https://elanthipedia.play.net/Necromancer#Circle_Requirements

# 3 Magics: Augmentation or Targeted Magic, Arcana, Attunement
# 5 Weapons (only Small Edged is needed to circle): Brawling, Light Thrown, Small Edged, Small Blunt, Crossbow
# 2 Armors (only 1 is needed to circle): Light Armor, Shield Usage
# 7 Survivals: Stealth, Outdoorsmanship, Athletics, Perception, Skinning, Evasion, First Aid
# 3 Lores (only 2 are needed to circle): Tactics, Scholarship, Appraisal

# Eventually you will need to train 2 more Magics to circle (for a total of 5)
# However, you will probably end up training them all since they each have very useful spells
# The other Magic skills are: Augmentation or Targeted Magic, Warding, Debilitation, Utility

# For your first spell, you should choose either Acid Splash or Obfuscation (uncomment whichever you choose below)
# If you choose Acid Splash, you will have an easier time reaching circle 2, but your rituals will be more obvious
# If you choose Obfuscation, you will need to listen to a Targeted Magic class to hit circle 2, but your rituals will be hidden from others
